<h2 align="center">To-do list as for now</h2>
<ul>
 
<li> âœ”	Implement shopkeeper logics and randomly spawned shops  </li>
<li> âœ” Implement damsel </li>
<li> âœ” Implement caveman </li>
<li> âœ” Implement skeleton </li>
<li> âœ” Implement arrow trap </li>
<li> âœ” Fix rope logics - if thrown, when it touches bottom of some tile above it or it reaches its maximum travel distance of 8 tiles up, then it should expand to the bottom. Now it's the opposite - it expands as it travels upwards. </li>
<li> âœ” Implement cape and jetpack </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Putting project on Travis </li>
<li> âœ” Implement 4 layers system - top one for the console and HUD, bottom one for tilemap and the rest for other creatures </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Tune-up the level generator; make it more random; add random events like snake well </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Implement music using streaming from filesystem - I elaborated a bit on this on my blog: https://dbeef.wordpress.com/2018/05/24/some-words-on-developing-spelunkyds/ </li> 
<li> ðŸ—™ Pausing </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Jars dropping loot </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Ghost when spending too much time on level </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Shake screen when dropping a bomb </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Add github link to the main menu's copyrights sprite - so people would find the current version even if it was downloaded from some other source </li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Attempt to make levels a bit bigger (current size is 512x512, what I can probably make is 1024x512 or 512x1024, though not sure of that) </li>


</ul>
 
 Obviously I omit things like implement Olmec or implement lava city - let's finish cave level first.

<h2 align="center">Known bugs</h2>
<ul>
 
<li> ðŸ—™ Though overall randomness of the generator is improved it sometimes makes some ugly structures, to be fixed later</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ I messed up a bit with collision detection</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Arrow trap is triggered even if there's a tile (or tiles) between some moving object and the trap</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Once thrown chest can't be opened</li>
<li> âœ” Sometimes there's a level where there are spikes just hanging in air</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Sometimes you can loose your items (shotgun, pistol) when changing levels</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ UI bugs - you can throw rope / drop bomb in scores screen</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Damage system appears to be broken in terms of shopkeeper (you can't throw arrows, rocks, jars, etc on him)</li>
<li> âœ” There's a bug when carrying damsel while sprinting through spikes</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ There's a bug when jumping on more than one NPC (snake, bat, etc) at the same time</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Displaying loot in level-transition screen</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Shopkeeper is quite dumb, easy to steal</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Bullets can collide with jetpack, so it can work as a bulletproof vest</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Blood drops / bullets can trigger arrow trap</li>
<li> ðŸ—™ Game tends to crash after some time of playing (at least on my vanilla DS) </li>

</ul>
 

<h2 align="center"> Building </h2>

<p> 1) Download devkitPro for your platform from their official website: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started </p>
<p> 2) Set up a few environment variables, as shown in their tutorial  </p>
<p> 3) cd to the spelunky-ds directory and type 'make'  </p>

<h2 align="center"> Running </h2>
<p> For running on a PC I preffer an emulator called Desmume. type 'desmume spelunky.nds' for running. </p>
<p> For running on an NDS I use 'R4i-3DS-RTS-WiFi' (oh boy) card, but it's probably going to work on any other card. Just make sure, you have NDS program called 'DSiMenu++', which helps running homebrew. Installation instructions:

<h2 align="center"> Tools I use </h2>
<ul>
  <li> C++ </li>
  <li> GNU Make </li>
  <li> libnds - as included with devkitPro's toolchain https://devkitpro.org/ </li>
  <li> mappy - https://tilemap.co.uk/mappy.php </li>
  <li> desmume emulator </li>
  <li> R4 card for testing on a real Nintendo </li>
  <li> gimp, for converting to 256 color (8bit) indexed bmp/png </li>
  <li> a real Spelunky code for inspiration ofcourse, distributed by Derek Yu on this address: http://www.derekyu.com/games/spelunky_1_1_src.zip </li>
  <li> Spelunky assets, I take them from the Spelunky Community Update Project because there's no need for installing Game Maker: https://github.com/tyrovc/SpelunkyCommunityUpdateProject </li>
